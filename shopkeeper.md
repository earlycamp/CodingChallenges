# TheShopkeeper

Implement a program that helps shopkeepers in their shops.

### Level 1

Imagine a shopping scenario. 

1. A person is able to see what is available in the supermarket with various prices and details:

| Item     | Amount | Cost per item |
| -------- |:------:| ----:|
| Milk     | 1      | 55   |
| Honey    | 1      | 258  |
| Eggs     | 1      | 357  |
| Bread    | 1      | 50   |
| Spinach  | 1      | 42   |
| Towel    | 1      | 256  |
| Soda     | 1      | 65   |



2. The customer should be able to select the items that they want from the shop, buy the items and get a bill at the end.

3. The customer should be prompted to pay and an amount collected by the shopkeeper from the customer.

4. Then the customer should be able to get the correct change.

5. Let the program start by greeting and asking the person what their name is. It should be able to continue using that name.


### Rules
1. The program should run on a terminal. This is a core language question.
2. Solve in order and submit two results for level 1
3. Use coding best practices:
    important: Comment you code//
4. There should be a proper readme with an explanation of how your program works.
